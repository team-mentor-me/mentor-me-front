### Hunter's couple of notes
#### Don't **Fork** the Repo
##### Git Instructions
- Every frontend/UI developer will be working on this repo, but on separate branches.

- After git cloning THIS repo, do:
   
   - You may need to `git pull` before creating a new branch.
   
  - `git branch [firstname-lastname]` <-----  Creates the branch with your first and last name as branch name. 
     
  - `git checkout [firstname-lastname]` <---- Switches your working directory into your newly created branch.
  
  - `git push -u origin [firstname-lastname]` <-- Pushes that branch to github.

      - subsequent pushes after the above push can be done with `git push [firstname-lastname]`
   
   you can then `git commit` into that branch wth all your changes.

##### Initial Instructions
- You still need to run `yarn install` to get your node_modules.

- This is the front end repo, I forgot to include front end in the name and changing it would be rough.
